## Overview

This was the first time I used svelte. It took me 3 days to learn enough svelte before I could even attempt this challange.
As someone from backend development, this was the most fun I have ever had building a frontend project.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Built with

### What I learned

Since this was the first time I used svelte, I had no idea what I was getting into. There are lots of cool stuff I've learned to do in svelte.
Such as loop using svelte.
Using scope CSS feels odd but amazing.
Import and export variables.
Global CSS - :global(body)
Also learned how to deploy svelte repo in vercel.
