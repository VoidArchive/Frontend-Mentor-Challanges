## Overview

This was the first time I used svelte. It took me 3 days to learn enough svelte before I could even attempt this challange.
As someone from backend development, this was the most fun I have ever had building a frontend project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

Since this was the first time I used svelte, I had no idea what I was getting into. There are lots of cool stuff I've learned to do in svelte.
Such as loop using svelte.
Using scope CSS feels odd but amazing.
Import and export variables.
Global CSS - :global(body)
Also learned how to deploy svelte repo in vercel.
